        <p>
            "(02:44) good evening everyone so i am the bucket i work as a project coordinator at opa i would like to welcome you to this weapon and the title of cabernet's acidizing principle and practices that we will so i think my colleague is having a (04:06) small problem in the internet connection i will take over uh for the introduction then give my presentation so welcome to this webinar everyone uh under the carbonates acidizing principles and practice uh this title will be presented by engineering j ust a slight uh introduction about injured he's a senior reservoir engineer at gpc in egypt his experience in many areas like the reserve for engineering simulation model analysis pta and reservoir economics is also an experienced instructor for reservoir economics course and he (04:44) delivered one course with us before uh in opa he has a bachelor's degree in patrol engineering from swiss canada university and diploma in contracting administrating for project managers from auc so before we sta rt with this uh interesting webinar i will give a short presentation about our upcoming courses in plan our june plan uh so first of all i'm i'm a hammett business developer at opa uh so for june uh first of all we have the recorded courses uh right now we have nine recorded courses uh the price (05:23) prices you can see on the left are the original prices before the discount because we have a big discount right now running each one of these courses is between 15 and 20 hours actually and it co ntains exercises and assignments also you will get support from instructors when you need when you need it or you have any questions uh there will be a certificate of completion after you submit uh all the assignments and as i mentioned before the patreon economics course is by engineering who's giving the webinar today so after the (05:55) discount which is the aid offer which one that we standed since like two weeks ago so we decided to extend this over to let more people join it because it's a big offer 75 percent discount on the prices that i mentioned before uh you can register for this course by simply scanning this code by your phone and registering or by filling in the link that michael league will send in the chat right now so please send it chad if you're here uh okay so you can scan the code or you can contact opa after the webinar and register and (06:42) recorded courses also uh engineering sent the link in the chat so you can fill it in if you're interested in the recorde d courses in one of the nine courses or more so you can just search through this link our second offer or our second planned course or type of course is the uh hydraulic fracturing using fractate which was supposed to to start uh almost 10 days ago but we decided to to extend the time of the start till 5th of june due to the exams for the most of the people who registered already so this is a nice opportunity (07:25) for the people who who see the offer for the first time because you can rest in this course and benefit from still the ramadan of which is 40 discount 149.99 uh this is a two weeks course and one week project 35 to 40 hours

support from instructor to answer all your questions inside and outside the sessions also you will get a certificate (07:56) of completion of the course which w ill strengthen your cv and show that you're a professional and the hydraulic fracturing using flaccid so what will you learn in this course you learn about stimulation candidate selection hydraulic fracture basic concepts fracture modeling basic geomechanics and log interpretation fracture software how to use fractate fracture equipment prop and hydraulic fracture fluids diagnostic pumping interpretation fracture treating pressure interpretation fracture jump q aqc post fracture (08:29) producti on so the calendar for this course as you can see here the green days are the course days which will start on 5th of june the orange ones are the break days so after each two course days there will be a break day to refresh and to revision uh what was taken the days before and also sometimes to solve some exercises and the last week will be uh project days and the blue color so in this week you will be working on a project or solving a bunch of assignments that need to be submitted at the end of the course (09:05) so if

email check your uh junk box your spam and you'll find uh within one week thank you for listening to my presentation and now i give the mic to (11:27) engineering excuse me can you hear me well now yes i can hear you john okay so before engine armor i would like to introduce engine armor to you and sorry for this technical issue on my microphone so engineering is a senior reservoir engineering gpc is experienced in many areas that are live reservoir engineering simulation nodal analysis pta and visible economics engineer armor has also experienced as an instructor for reasonable economics courses he had his baccalaureate degree in petroleum engineering from soviet (12:06) scandal university and diploma and contracting administrating for project management from auc and now engine armor will conduct his technical session so engineering so now in general this is yours so thanks jade and omar for this interesting introduction i would like to welcome everybody and good eve ning follow for all of you so what i'm going to do now is i will will present some ideas and principles about carbonating so do you see my screen now armor and yes yes it's clear okay so again welcome everybody for this (12:59) presentation so our agenda today will be we will talk about well stimulation objective then we will go to a carbonate acidizing principle then we will talk about some typical workflow that we use in oxidizing then we will talk about the challenge and the recommended data set this challenge then finally we'll talk about cases study so as a battle engineer the first important equations for us is the world productivity equation which is the flow rate is equal to permeability multiplied by base thickness multiplied by the two down (13:36) which is as of pressure minus bottom hole pressure i divided by the viscosity of the fluid multiplied by the formation and volume factor of the fluid plus the skin factor so as a petroleum engineer we have here two factors to incre ean out and then we have matrix treatment this injection of treating fluid are usually done below the fracture pressure we want to we want we don't want to make effect in in this treatment the second objective is to create new flow capacity in our reservoir as is by increasing the flow area connected to the reservoir by highly conductive channel and this is done by (14:53) hydraulic fact which is group fact or acid frag usually injection of the treating fluid done by uh by bombing pressure by bo ell not injected into the formation second technique available in the market is the mathematics associating and the matrix as dicing which is solved work components dwelling fluid velocity clay and any type of permission that measures to improve the well information connectivity usually the damage is so called the new elbow depth cells thermometer from sandy face usually typical volume for this matrix is rising treatment from 50 to 200 gallon per foot and this small volume treatment injected bel te so this is a sandstone oxidizing we have here the quality is green and then we have a clay filling in (18:00) the booze and declaring lining in the booth and usually we have some cement in the material usually carbonate and some damage here so we want to remove all the damage here and the clay to make the boost best larger than so we end up after the treatment with this group configuration usually in acid we inject acid and dissolve the rock itself to bypass the damage and the form what is ca tor formula so scheme factor is a dimensionless parameter account for additional pressure dope due to the damage as the nail would grow and represent it by what is called the hauken's formula scale is equal to the version formation (19:50) per mobility divided by the damaged zone the mobility minus one then the depth of the of the of the damage area divided by the new as a willpower radius rw so if s is positive this will indicate that our reservoir is damaged if this is negative this means that one we can record ability and we can see that the damage zoom provide no production so as a general rule avoiding the damage is much easier than dealing with it so if you are going to do a workover operation so you must follow the standard guidelines for downloading this operation to make as damage is less because this is the general rule of our (21:46) acid is usually not the magic solution because acid because treatment will depend on the type of the damage so you should know what is the damag rganic deposit we can use solvent in acid dispersion and if finally if we have damage due to cells or clay we can use also a mod asset so what is carbonate formation a carbon networks by definition it's contain more than 50 percent of carbonate mineral the most common carbonate method are calcite or arjunite antidomite we have two types of work limestone and dolomite the limestone is greater than fifty percent in calcite iodolomite is greater than fifty percent (23:44) uh into the mite cmg03 by in carbonate but usually we need to do a characterization for the cabinet (25:09) to make to select the best equipment for our cabinets so usually this is the carbonate action with limestone uh this is the chemical formula for the reaction uh calcium carbonate reacts with hcl producing calcium colloid as a salt plus co2 plus h2o dolomite they react with hcl and give the product like calcium chloride magnesium chloride water h2o and co2 and the benefit the advantage of this reaction that both cac l with carbonate we should know what is the moral as the action of acid in bruce carbonate usually result in formation of highly conductive lobothic as this flu path which we know (27:29) as a bacteria called the wormhole wormhole are capable of bypassing any damage we have you know support so if we want to make a carbonator slicing so we want to make a job that is a result in warm water formation so because our condition to make this form of removal is usually depend on two things the first one termine your optimum injection rate usually we make uh what's called the cool flood test and the from this school philadelphia we can know as an injection rate uh that is the volume to go through is the minimum so usually this experiment we we made it by by increasing the injection rate and see how much (29:29) volume of acid needed so at low uh injection rate we we have here what is called dissolution and then we increase our injection rate we have a warm hole then we after this point we can se lation job then we go to a lab experience the type of the damage and the location of the damage then we select our treatment with this include composition additive volumes then we will use we select our diversion depending on the physical and geological interpretation of the logs then we apply then we go to the implement as the job at the site then we evaluate the treatment success and if we have any issue we can modify as a (31:42) stimulation guidelines so the first step is candidate selection your (32:51) information mineralogy as this happened by your analysis and the xrd and the selection uh this is a graph show as xrd and there from this exciting you can know the percentage of each terminal in your work this is the same section we can determine the the second velocity from this same section then we do what is called acid the solubility test asset solubility test to know the formation material and material and we'll confirm it with xrd and we use the same treatment fluid to make t velocity and the phone components also we can have vulnerability so we have many types of asset uh the first one is mineral hcl uh this uh able uh to dissolve the (35:08) carbonate it's a it has a concentration up to 28 to by weight but that is the disadvantage of hcl is that it's high highly corrosive and because oil is large uh another type of acids is organic acid we have acetic acid and formic acid they are weaker acid and comparable to hcl but they are used for high temperature wells greate ation job this includes inhibitors republican performing agents clay foreign and dislodge agent by the so each one of these in catalog or you can ask them so i should know why you use inhibitor so if you use hcl you should use and help to use the collusion rate so for each one you have to know uh the (37:25) functionality of this additive so the general function is to prevent excessive collusion uh prevent sludging prevent emulsion prevent iron recitation improve the coverage of acid of all zoom about in our presentation is the challenge so what is the challenge that we need in asset first one is the choosing desired candidate to perform as a job the second one is to design the optimum treatment and this should be should have experimental uh lab tests to know what is type of the rubbish third one is to choose the autumn diverter to to get to to to treat all the zones for acid with acid uh fourth one is the knowing the current fracture gradient (39:32) usually we don't have the current we expected (40:50) some depletion in the new adult world so usually we have this recommended also open all those uh usually imaging globe and nmr but then we usually recommend the electric clocks uh to estimate the water saturation exactly of the depleted there so if we see here the water saturation is uh is all over the body carbonyl body and if we did this we should expect that we produce water uh also we can obtain case the whole logs like pulses [Music] which give us uh equation and water ant all of this all of these layers they're taking fluid so we inject diverter to make to make sure that we cover all of these layers (43:05) so typically what is called degree flush stage and this may include the insult like nh4cl or kcl as a function of the pre-flush stage to displace the formation flows away and to convert the zork to water weight so it shows out ability here playing stage displays as oil by means of xylene or autovine to make europe clean then we have main acid stage and wha a perforated integral uh 40 food usually we make it at the two diverter stage which means stage and so on so this is guidelines uh for example lens and how many number you need in your autofocus so what is new in matrix advising we have three different areas in (45:22) development in research and development we have what is called the fiber optic enabled coil tube this is called tube with fiber optic this allows recording distributed to virtual survey during the treatment with some and we can mo culate uh so from english language from image look we can see that we have a natural fracture and by current they have a 97 uh natural fracture in this interval which will we make our proliferation uh from the metaphysical analysis we get scw equal to 20 we have five effective uh effective velocity is around the 20 25 we have an input of a 60 meter we have a probability from 30 to 30 mls so based on (47:41) this integration of the data we decided to perform assets that remove the dwelling damage use other (49:10) vector at the beginning and then we make two stage of acid this acid stage then uh divert us in this stage to determine injection rate we need to know our fracture gradient so due to we don't have any sonic data due to determining fracture gradient so we used our original experience uh that field was a normal faulting regime so we use the minimum fracture gradient for normal faulting as a point sacrifice of the foot and this will lead us to determine our injection rate so our lowing with 500 oil per day and the phone as they built up this two weekends which around the minus half so this means that the poses are successful and the machine (51:30) again with the scanning pollution during so thank you and my presentation and greeting your question thank you for this interesting uh presentation uh so if you have any question please drop it in the chat uh i will read some questions for you and your armor and maybe you can answer them okay you can ask me as a question okay ll the well in a brown field so you should have open hole loads like uh nmr and damage plus what is called dielectric clocks as dielectric locks provide us with two or two measurements which actually used in its equation m and the ends and cementation factor and (53:44) the saturation for exponents so by the dielectric node so we know exactly without the saturation profile and the oil saturation and if you if you don't have open hollow logs we can make it use the pulse newton tools to make it al ut first of all you should remove eliminate any mechanical problem that may happen so if you have a casing leak or a tubing leak you should know that all all the system is okay the casing and the tubing and the reversion so then the only question will be about the skin so if this is positive we do as a job okay so we have another question how (55:44) many days or hours it takes for a citizen operation usually depends on on the intervals that we treat maybe we take one hour or two hours depends o please everyone make sure to fill this form so we can always fulfill your needs and uh enhance and be better uh so if anyone please still have any question uh make sure to drop it in the chat so engine armor can answer it okay it seems that we have no more questions so i want to thank you and your armor again for this interesting presentation it seems that all the attendees are really glad in this presentation as you can see in the chat (58:13) so thank you everyone uh f"
