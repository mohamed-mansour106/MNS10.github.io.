        <p>
            "(02:41) okay um (13:23) everyone welcome to our webinar today oil stimulation for oxidizing technique i'm abdullah from reservoir solution company thus i will do five minutes presentation about our company reservoir solutions reservoir solutions is a company specialized in providing technical studies and courses for oil and gas companies and professionals also the company incorporates many professionals with diverse technical background related to oil and gas exploration and production for our s ervices that we are providing we are providing technical reservoir (14:04) studies field development planning reservoir static and dynamic modelling economic visibility studies technical support for academic researches assisting and writing technical papers and publish it technical petroleum courses by industry expertise providing mentorship programs for our next course it's about static and dynamic reservoir modeling it will be two weeks and it's on workshop for the content for that course it's about two weeks from scratch data to a complete reservoir model so by attending this course you will (14:52) enjoy lifetime access to recorded sessions so if the time of that course is not suitable for you due to time difference or any other things you can join and take the advantage of have lifetime access to the recorded decisions also we will have datasets for application because that is a practical course the course material will be provided and at the end of the course we will have two day s project to enhance the understanding of the concepts and the theories that we will take during the course you will have open discussion with the (15:32) instructor even during the course and after the course so if you have any problem after the course you can have mentorship

that our contact is that will be shared into the zoom shack now engineer payment will start his (18:35) presentation thank you all hello hi engineering hello yeah did you have nothing (19:40) yes you can start now you can share your presentation yeah a nd welcome to today's my webinar about the simulations and especially about the exercising let's start our webinar with our outliners and which i want to let's load my presentation and the engineer payment uh could you (20:43) close the camera because i think that's a connection and these are our outliners damage the skin factor acidizing and treatment close camera yes because the connection is not the beast that's okay uh yes it's equivalent now nice okay yeah yeah that's okay okay guys i'm sor ry about that because i'm now on board on the simulation vessel i i have a limitation about my speeding internet sorry about this one again about the athletes acidizing and the treatment so let's uh start our web liners and (21:37) first let's remind you what is the value simulation a valley stimulation is a very interference intervention performed on an oil and gas to increase production by improving improving the flow of hydrocarbons from the drainage area into the valve so let's remind you a modern farm formula about the production one of the modern formula you know you can see that the production rate permeability thickness scheme factor and radius and the drainage area and the oil function are always viscosity if you can see in this (22:22) formula you can see that if you decrease in s you can lead to [Music] increase in your production so some parameter that's important for us and with a simulation techniques we can do or we can do about all of them or increase or decrease the pa rameter so let's go to know about the sum simulation techniques here we have some simulation techniques here we have some assimilation techniques mechanical chemical biological and the combined mechanical and chemical and thermometers these are the stimulation techniques but (23:09) here only we just talked about the acidizing that uh decrease the s or the skin factor to increase the production rate so now i just want to tell you about the formation damage what is the formation damage formation damage is a condition most commonly caused by available fluid use during drilling completion and work forward and it impairs the formality of reservoirs rocks that were reducing the natural bird activation it means that whenever your permeability near the billboard will decrease it means that your formation or your (24:02) reservoir now has a damage so we need to cure this fun it means that whenever you have the formation damage you should cure it with the simulation techniques as you can see yo formation damage around the well it means that when you want to tell in engineering about the formation damage when you tell the name of the formation damage you only tell that the name of the formation damage but whenever you you want to use it in your formula you need a parameter or a number that quantifies the formation damage and the skin factor when you want to use it for formation damage if (26:49) show that it's negative it means that your fellow or your production now in an improvement ger and lead to again production rate decrease i talked about the skin factor formation damage briefly only i just want to talk about the acidizing because acidizing decrease the skin factor and remove some damages that are removed by oxidizing this is important just briefly i told about the formation damage and skin factors what is an acidizing acidizing is a technique that used in oil and gas extraction extraction that is designed to lengthen the useful life of the oil and gas well (30:00) thi formic acid you know we use these two mineral type of these two type of the mineral acid for the acidizing this is the main type of the acid for acidizing hcl and hf but the organic acid reaction by the formation is more slower than the mineral acid but i talk about the reaction let's go to see the reaction of hcl acid ocef acid and the formic and the acetic acid why because whenever we know about the stigmatal number and the formula reaction of the acid by formation we can use this parameter to acid wash acid push is only used for the some formation damages in near (34:39) development or for the mud filtrate something like multiple thread or your preparation has affected by some solid element and you use it the acid watch for treating this one and another one this is the fracture fracture acidizing what is the fracture acidizing whenever your injection rate in pulping acid above the fracture pressure of the formation you do a fracture oxidizing whenever your injection rate below the fr as possible what is our fracture as it does i told before fracture acidizing involves the injection of acid down the well at the rate faster than the formation can accept it by the way of natural fluid channels (37:29) whenever the fractures cannot accept these these pressure these rates the pressure build up and go up and finally the rock ruptures and the acid inject to effect a fracture within the carbon formations every time when you want to choose a treatment or even you want to uh check th ill answer to all your questions as i can thank you i will answer some factors are important for the fracture geometry as like as the injection rate followed viscosity fluid volume injected fluid loss drug properties and the formation fluids stresses and the reaction rates when you wash the (40:22) the injection rate is more important because whenever you inject the acid into a fracture into the carbonate formations if your rate exceed the pressure exceed the fracture pressure and your rate is m hat that pumping by a spatial fluid into a maybe acid or maybe some following some some another fellow acid especially for matrix that's in there i think i remove some mud filtering or something that close the pulsar but when we have a scale we have a scale problem we should use the solvent for escape for example for biome sulfonate (43:14) symphony you should use a keyword or medicine for only the volumes i told before if you have some form and maybe maybe in a well we have some formation damag a fracture jobs fracture acidizing jobs or maybe we need to frac hydraulic fracturing jobs and then we have uh for the gas spent one day is okay one milliliter say you can do the matrix as it does it just now we have two types of the formation that are told before the carbonate carbonate we can see the matrix acidizing you know (46:09) since the flow channels and pores in a carbonate are acid soluble permeability can increase significantly in the power in the part of the formation that the acid or wellbore clean out another one is nws or near velvet stimulation another one intermediate mattress simulation and one of the important one is extended matrix acidizing as you can see velvet clean that actually clean out is like as a acid brush only for the removing uh the mod maybe more format tray or the removing damages near the valve or maybe in a centimeters or some inches nothing more and the volume is for the (48:51) uh createment is about the 10 to 25 gps it means the gallon per foot a and the primarity is uh will be so much as before and with the ema through eight main three expand you can approach this to that one because ema treatment the volume is so much and the rate is so much and you can create the and the permeability will be so much and it is okay and you can see here our skin factor doesn't exceed minus five in a carbonate reservoir every time our venever we design the acid jobs and we do it in a proper (52:08) only we can decrease skin factor to minus five you can s can see here whenever our temperature above the 20 to 222 fahrenheit the strength of the hcl will decrease and whenever our temperature decrease our estrogens will increase it means that the reaction the reaction rate is depend on the temperature remind this one because you whenever you want to find the solution find the treatment or volume of the essay you need this reminder in a sanderson (55:11) the material that you can remove it is a clay silica coating or the cement or the cement cement th 08) that every time sensation by the water can be solved by v hf as you can see here one of the important thing to choose a best experience about eighth mixture of the hcl and hashes i see one is the chorus at the core flow study and another one is the temperature temperature forget about what fit the uh fulfill our study in a burial standard zones for example you can see that the best takes the best estuaries is the 15 percent hcl and the four percent matrix acidizing carbonate what is the matr as you remember i told about this four types of the matrix acidizing and the range is to about the intermediate matrix acidizing the e and v uh category the ema in a fracture as it does we can we can category the ema matrix as it does in time to categor to a fracture acidizing and you know the hcl acid reaction by formation is so fast and when we want to use a matrix acidizing when we want when we want to do a matrix acidizing by hcl and we want the effective matrix acidizing we should (1:00:42) zones in the near developer area and the reduces oil productions in this type of formation that these (1:02:37) damages may occur we should prepare a horizontal and when we want to acidizing the horizontal well we should consider all aspects that we use it in a vertical way but in a vertical way you can use acid brush it means that you can pull head and acid into a bed but in a horizon but in a horizontal tablet you can not you can not use a ball heading in a horizontal bit because in a horizont 75 percent of production and you can improve your production to 75 percent this is only the articular study and the name is the 7525 rule diversion techniques mechanical diversion (1:05:44) and the chemical diversion you can see that all particle formancy and viscose diversion what is a mechanical as you can see here when you then be wants to divert acid to zone b between zone b and a we set a packer retrievable bridge block between the b and c and we send our coil or our tubing uh top of the z unreactive fluid and inject it to wet to create a filtration and a formation that has a parent zone and create a resistance of the flow of reactive flowy to a high performance and divert it to another zone so again those two were injected to wet and sit on there and see and create the filter cake on a permabel zone and (1:08:40) divert the acid to another source the form acid again for masses as light as like as the ball ceilings do and as like as the particulate and earth formacy what is the p ing all additive company that made the additive argument about this procedure about the viscose fluid divergence the viscose following divergence increase the flow resistance in the layer taking the excess excessive amount of treatment flow so that the flow diverted into a new layer yes in in this type of diversion techniques when we want (1:11:49) to create a divergence as like as a viscose fluid we use acid polished by some chemical and a polymerase effect we go to another slide to show you an clean up the web so if you cannot practice this cannot if you cannot break this diverter so you in the well remain the sludges and it means that you you didn't do any acidizing jobs because you uh not only acid not only close the pores and also you decrease in productions now you can see here again as like as the box fillers and the main acid stages won't go injected to well and after that the vca coming (1:14:57) and leave the main assets go inside to per unturned zone and low prime zone and a s but in fbda when we inject a mutual solvent into a well the mutual solvent the mutual solvers feel we separate the molecular of the after vda you know and break the vda i forgot the word you know break the vda some formation damages caused by matrix aciditizing you know (1:18:04) we have some formation damages um we do a matrix acidizing for decrease s scheme factor to increase the production but then we don't do our job in matrix as it dies for example improper designing improper injection im ter saturation in near available area and can take a long time to disappear maybe months or even year for low permeability formations and the following compatibility you can cure it by checking laboratory acid precipitation when react by the oil or fluid of the wet or vitability changes by choosing improper surfactants for a cure or for remove the formation damages but by matrix we use some additives (1:20:50) let's go some additive important additives that are famous we know about all of them i 1:22:26) stable the clay in a acid by whenever the reaction the diverting agent i told them about the video or vca as like as the ada or vas chemical the mutual solvent and the iron controller you know the mutual solvent and iron control and alcohol these are all chemicals are important but these chemicals i think is more important than other you know the mutual solvent tied to providing or assists to providing water red formations to maintain the best relative permeability to oil or to prevent g agents such as citric acid or edta or nta and reducing agent converting follicules and the ferrous converting frameworks to ferrous (1:24:56) this is a table that you can see that uh some type of the iron controller for the temperature and the amount of and some benefit and disadvantages sorry because i think that i have no enough time and i should uh uh tell you more i should uh explain it uh so fast i think and another one this is the acid additive with alcohol alcohol again as long as too i on control does compatibility that's our emulsion test diverting performance test and the some procedure that should do in a laboratory after that when you get your result the step three is uh is uh to calculate uh is calculate the volume of the uh it's calculated to volume of the acid (1:27:17) and diverter okay that i told before that the saturated number and all of them is important that for this step and another step is that is the calculate of the pumping pressure the pumping pressure whene pumping acid why is the first stop pre-flush may be non-acidic or acidic you know peripheral as like as the the peripheral performance is to to prepare the formations for main acid you know uh i don't have enough time to explain it more but just this is the main idea that we use the peripheral and another one is the main accident of diverter because we we should cover all (1:29:26) of them the interval and we the interval divided to some part to some uh lens and that each lens need as one is sa know about its asset and equipment in designing you know whenever you don't have any assimilation with it you can uh create or design a designer as a video simulation but this is a normal jobs and i think that this is a last slide before the procedure in deep clearance simulations i don't have enough time to explain about the nuclear escalation versus so whenever the matrix acid doesn't jumps down the important jobs then after the multi-succession jobs is the clean of (1:31:30) the web whenever can uh acidize it uh easily because it's not important so (1:33:21) much but whenever your uh permanent is about for oil well 10 milli darcy and the gas valley is one million that is okay i think uh if your questions uh about this uh answer i think that this is a this is your answer and another thing is that vending machine information and water tools and another person to ask questions what are tools for diversion techniques diversion techniques you know uh one of them is the retreat uh tools ur season uh so thank you for again for that interesting decision i think that many of people will be uh required and be pressing that to review the decision again on our (1:35:58) youtube channel so share the link for decision uh on our linkedin profile and also we will share it into our whatsapp groups thank you all engineering and thank you for all the attendees that attended our session today thank you okay and thank you so much and i hope you enjoyed if your question "
