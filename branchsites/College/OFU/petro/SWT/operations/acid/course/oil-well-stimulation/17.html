            <ol>
                <span>Here’s a summary of acid stimulation in oil wells based on various sources:</span>
                <li>
                    <b><u>Introduction and Background (00:02 - 01:50):</u></b> Dr. Ahmed Algarhy is introduced, highlighting his expertise and research in well stimulation and hydrocarbon recovery. The session marks the beginning of a course on well stimulation, with quizzes after each lecture.
                </li>

                <li>
                    <b><u>Formation Damage (03:56 - 15:59):</u></b> Dr. Algarhy explains the importance of porosity and permeability in reservoirs, detailing how damage during drilling, cementing, and other operations can reduce permeability and affect production. He introduces the concept of "skin" and how formation damage impacts oil and gas recovery.

                </li>
                
                <li>
                    <b><u>Formation Damage and Chemical Effects (11:48 - 18:10):</u></b> The lecture covers how chemical reactions, like changes in wettability, can negatively affect oil and gas production, leading to water production instead of hydrocarbons.

                </li>
                
                <li>
                    <b><u>Hydraulic Fracturing (36:39 - 42:25):</u></b> Dr. Algarhy discusses hydraulic fracturing as a method to enhance production by creating fractures in the formation, with stages involved in this process. The lecture clarifies the role of proppants and fracture fluids in keeping fractures open.

                </li>
                
                <li>
                    <b><u>Well Stimulation Techniques and Challenges (49:44 - 1:20:11):</u></b> The final part focuses on the use of hydraulic fracturing for sand control, the importance of constant injection rates during stimulation, and the difference between fixing formation damage and bypassing it. The lecture concludes with the need to properly diagnose issues before applying well stimulation techniques.

        <h3>transcript </h3>
        <p>
            "(00:02) so good morning good afternoon and good evening hope you are all doing well and staying safe i am maryam shreve a senior petroleum engineering student at the lebanese american university and i'll be moderating today's session i want to begin by wishing you all a safe healthy and prosperous new year full of achievements and success our session today is the first session of the course titled introduction to wealth stimulation presented by a proficient speaker with an extensive experience i national ogs halda patrolling company texas tech university and solomon and associates uh moreover dr elgarhe (01:50) published many journals and research papers with severe spe as uh spwla and arna in addition he full two year as patent applications uh to applications uh to increase uh hydraulic hydrocarbon recovery in both conventional and unconventional reservoirs on a final note if you have any question related to the technical content of the presentation please feel free to drop it down in ou will see a code and section two you will see a second code only you use one code why because you know one classroom has 1 000 students so if we have like let's say uh 1500 students we cannot put all of them in one section (03:56) in one class so we need to have two classes and you need to register only one time so please don't go and register twice uh in each section so so just one time okay also remember there's a quiz after each lecture so four lectures uh mean four quizzes and there's a fi gas inside a layer or a formation or what we call a reservoir we need to have porosity we need to have some uh space and this space you know uh it filled with a hydrocarbon and some water okay so this is our reservoir but remember if there's no connectivity between the spools i mean if there's no permeability if (06:04) this oil or gas or water cannot flow from somewhere inside the reservoir to another place and for sure i wanted to move to uh the wellbore it means there is no permeability so i r you get jobs you can learn more and more about formation damage okay also if we have a formation damage this will give you a positive skin but right now we didn't know what is skin mean so just wait for a few minutes and i will teach you what is skin mean and what does positive skin mean okay okay so damage during well life starting from the drilling mainly because of the drilling of fluids also during the (08:09) cementing also the perforation also during completion of work over operation als now uh (09:43) flow to the flow of the oil or gas and water because you know when we produce we produce all most likely we produce all of them together most likely i will have some oil some gas and some water in most of the reservoirs and any restriction in the tubing for example because of the organic deposition i can consider that mechanical uh formation damage also okay okay so by the way we have two types of you know two main mechanism if we have this deposition happened because of chemical ct something that will change the wattability and changing with ability of the reservoir (11:48) will affect the oil and gas production for sure okay and there's also considered affirmation damage also maybe because of fines invasion or fines migration when small particles moves from somewhere inside the reservoir to another place inside the reservoir and gets stuck at some poor throats when it when these particles get stuck in four throats for sure it will uh damage the permeability and will st omething by mistake and this chemical for example change the watability and make that reservoir instead of being water with become oil wet so the reservoir would like to attract and keep (13:57) the oil and kick out the water and you will start producing more water instead of more oil and this is for sure not something good because we are petroleum engineers not water engineers we are here in this business to produce oil and gas and not to produce water okay it may occur any time maybe from day n you decide how to fix it it is very similar to a patient when you go to a physician of a doctor the doctor will not give you any medicine before he understand exactly what kind of disease that you have if the doctor don't know what kind of disease or what kind of uh problems in your health he will not (15:59) give you any medicine correct so the same thing here in our oil and gas industry okay um also it may you know again it may be single it may be you know complex like multiple types and it t okay so if i am producing from a big lateral or a long lateral and a horizontal well i can know exactly from where i'm getting the water why because i sent a production logging tool and i can figure out from where i'm getting this excess of water okay also i can get a sample i can get a sample okay and the sample may show that there is a lot of bacteria for example there's a lot of srb sulfur-reducing bacteria for example (18:10) also the sample may show that there's a lot of of uh scale and s 9:34) sludge okay also i may add something to control emulsion emulsion is like when we mix oil in water or you mix water in oil and you make something again it looks like a sludge in a muddy shape and if you want to know how emulsion look like you can get a cup of water put it in a mixer in your kitchen and you add two spoons or three spoons of oil like um the olive oil or whatever type of oil and mix them together you will see them become like a you know mix it together and we call that oil in on logging engineers all of these integrate together to figure out uh to evaluate to know exactly what is a (21:37) problem and to evaluate the problem and to decide what should be the right solution and again remember it is always better to avoid than to treat so for mission damage is your enemy your major enemy as a petroleum engineer is formation damage please keep this in your mind okay one of the major problems when we talk about formation damage because formation damage is something i can ecome 2000 so we double the production okay so this is you will see a negative skin factor but ev's as well used to produce 1 000 barrel per day and today produce 500 so produce only half it means there is a positive skin factor if the skin factor is zero it means i (23:58) did not touch the reservoir did not cause any information damage i did not do any stimulation okay okay okay so one more time the difference between a formation damage and oil stimulation i i think all of you know jose's guys t possible to have a positive scan of 100 it seems like 90 percent you know it seems like 60 percent of you said no it is impossible to be 100 positive 100. and around 40 percent of you said yes it can be okay so this is bad for me because the right answer is yes positive scan can be plus 100 (26:51) this is possible okay so thank you very much for participating in this question and i will end the polling you know the poll and i will share the results with you let me get a picture of it just for will not see that and for sure there's a a (29:52) mistake when you do that okay so uh for stimulation for the negative scan most likely we see something lower you know up to minus four but if you solve a problem in a book you may find minus seven or minus eight which is not uh realistic but you still you know uh see that when you do a mathematical model for the scan but for the positive scan yes it is okay to see a plus 100 to 150 there's no problem okay okay so here is one of the models there lfide and maybe uh fines migration and maybe bacteria so all of these things and also that the position of organic material like wax or paraffin all of (32:00) that will consider chemical factors okay okay uh finds migration i'd like to explain what is fines and migration because um a famous question what is the difference between fines migration and sand production okay so finds migration simply when a fine clays of quartz or any little particles move from somewhere inside the reservoir to anot well produce more oil and gas okay more oil and gas why because maybe i need my the oil price is very high these days maybe and i need to produce more oil to get more money okay maybe i get a formation damage problem and i lost a lot of production (34:17) and now i want to do a stimulation job to get more production to fix the formation damage problem or to bypass the formation damage problem and i will show you what is the difference between fixing the problem and bypassing the problem so when we need to use this fifth problem okay after you mix all of this together you will inject it down hole and it will go in front of the perforation and start building a bottom hole pressure that bottom hole pressure keeps increasing increasing increasing until the limit it will break the formation it will crack the formation it will make the formation uh become two parts (36:39) okay so and i will create two wings of of my fracture so there's a fracture would be like a wellbore in the middle and t in the middle to stay in the middle let me show you how i get these uh let's say this pen and instead of closing my my fracture i would keep this spin in the middle so still there are some gaps between my two hands so the hydrocarbon can flow through these gaps so i want to keep the fracture open so the simple answer if i ask you what is a function of a problem you can tell me a problem will keep the fracture open will not let the fracture close to (38:41) the end okay it will stay in the middle frag fluid with the propent (40:11) to create the fracture and starting from the next lecture i will give you more and more information about how we do a hydraulic fracturing job nowadays uh horizontal wells uh become very common but i cannot fracture all the lateral of all the horizontal section in one stage it is too hard for me to do that okay i cannot get pumps that can inject fluids to fracture 5 000 feet at the same time so i can i must do it in a stages so look to this different color he a sand contour we do it to stop as you are creating a screen inside your formation and the screen will stop the sand production inside the formation so sometimes we do (42:25) hydraulic fracturing for high permeable formation um not to enhance productivity but to stop sand production okay please watch this video there are many formations with multi-zone oil and gas reservoirs that are vertically drilled and stimulated using hydraulic fracturing to optimally recover these hydrocarbons in this ex bit cool it carries the cuttings to the surface and provides hydrostatic pressure prohibiting formation fluids from entering the wellbore as drilling approaches the depth of the first target zone a technician called a mud logger is brought on location he analyzes the cuttings identifying the (44:38) downhole lithology and any presence of hydrocarbons as the well is being drilled he provides real-time information to the company geologist and rig personnel once the bottom of the intermediate sect e first of these steps is to perforate or perf the casing a perforating gun is lowered by wire line to the lowest of the three target zones an electrical current is sent down the wire line to the perf gun setting off a charge which shoots holes through the steel casing cement and out of short distance into the target formation the perf gun is then pulled out of the hole the next step is to hydraulically (46:34) fracture or frack the zone here sand or other problems are pumped into the wellbore u al zones simultaneously result in greater cost efficiency and increased productivity [Music] okay so this video has a good summary of what we are doing in the oil and gas but the only comment i i want to tell you in this video we had three reservoirs we produced a three layers of three reservoirs at the same time this is not common in many countries for example in egypt in the western desert we have for example apache apache like to the american company the famous american company apache they li the same way you remember this name you remember your name okay so the x-axis is (49:44) the time the y-axis is the bottom hole pressure and look at the mouse i will do my best to have constant injection weight in real life it is go up and down but i will do my best to keep it constant okay it is better to keep it constant so my mathematical analysis later when i evaluate my job it will be better and the numbers i will get it will make more sense but if the injection rate go up and down and not ystem so when you stop injection we still for a short period of time maybe a second or two we still have a friction inside the system because when you stop injecting not all the fluid will stop immediately (51:58) in in all pipes okay so i we go a little bit here to get the isip then we'll keep recording the decline and at this point the fraction will close on the potent so after that we will call it reservoir dominated before that i will call it fracture dominated i will do analysis when testin g down calling down cooling down the reservoir and at some point the breakdown pressure keep decreasing decreasing because when you cool down the stresses will decrease okay so the breakdown pressure will decrease because of the calling effect so maybe after a month or two or a year or two the injector will get fractured unintentionally without planning to (54:13) fracture it also there is one of the very interesting applications of hydraulic fracturing is to use hydraulic fracturing as a dispos ch is the viscosity of the fluid which is water in this case okay and also he invented a new term called k which is a permeability the permeability of this uh medium okay so why i'm showing you this i'm showing you this because simply you can see the relation between q which is the injection rate of production rate and a which is a cross-section area of this pipe if you have a bigger pipe it will it will get you more water if you get a smaller pipe it will get you less pipe let's water right (56 han a vertical well without affection a fractured horizontal well would produce more than a horizontal (58:06) well without a fraction makes sense why because i am increasing the contact area between the well and the reservoir okay also when we create a hydraulic fracture here is a fraction here is a fraction of weights by the way fracture weights maybe one millimeter something very very very small just we make it too big here just to show you okay and the fractured lens may be 300 feet or 400 f ur home you go to your college your school and you decide to go back home and instead of going through very crowded places very crowded square and something like that you take the highway and go directly without stopping with no (1:00:06) traffic light no nothing no no cloud so the hydraulic fracturing is a highway okay and formation damage will make this highway or make the formation very crowded very like a you know a big square and um in a very in a rush hour okay okay what is the third reaso ot fix it but i will make a highway at the top of that square and you take your car drive your car and you instead of going through all this crowd and you lose a lot of time you will take (1:02:46) the highway so as a fracture with a highway so the fracture is bypassing the formation damage i'm not fixing it so the right answer here is hydraulic fracturing will fix the damage and not bypass it this is no this is wrong so the right answer is no okay okay so again one more time you know uh i want ever um you know i have a dry throat or whatever so this is symptoms okay how to diagnose he may ask you to uh let's say to get some tests to get a blood test to go and get a scan for your chest or whatever so this is these things we use it to diagnose so in oil and gas we have something similar (1:04:56) we do production logging this is very similar to a scan when you get a sample this is very similar when you get a blood test for example okay then also you you review the data the production da never we the well in the production period and we want to uh let's say do something let's say we get the suckerboat pump uh pipe get potted so i will call our cobra egg maybe or a pulling unit okay so we can call that a work over operation also sometimes we call a work over egg to do a fragile sometimes we do it trickless so we can consider a well stimulation job if it is hydrolytic fracturing or (1:06:59) acidizing or acid fracking we can consider that our coco even if we do it with using our c a frag job asset job and i would i need to select what should be the right acid and what is the right additives and maybe i will do asset facts so um uh sometimes we we we do a treatment without understanding every everything about the the problem which is not recommended but to understand the problem in a very very small details maybe will be very very expensive and your manager inside the company will not happy to spend a lot of money just whenever the production get declined uh (1:09:07) wit gn a specific type of hydraulic fractures we call it (1:10:25) fat and short fractures a fracture was very short and very fat very the width is big and the lens is short we do it for uh sand control to do like you are creating a screen inside the formation you know the screen we use in our kitchen a screen something like has holes in it so this holes will let the hydrocarbon and water go through and will stop the sand inside the formation so the sand will not reach the world bore and will stay a likely i will say most likely hydraulic fracturing will be better why because if it is a sand stone formation and i will do a hydraulic fraction i can (1:12:22) get the negative skin maybe to minus four or minus three means a lot of production but if i will do acidizing and this is a sandy stone formation for example i can get the negative scan most likely to zero in in sandstone when i do acidizing using hf and hcl most likely we cannot get any negative scan just like we are washing the format e for shade i wish this answer your question yes thank you and also someone asked when or in what cases can skin reach 100 okay so again this is very good question so whenever you you damage your reservoir let's say by mistake you're you're the tubing (1:14:27) very dirty has a lot of let's say bacteria a lot of scale a lot of deposits and you keep injecting and you injected something a chemical by mistake for example that dissolved all of these solids from the tubing and now you are injecting p use i did not get the question uh like if you have water conning okay and uh skin damage i think you know there is no direct relation between corn corning water corning and the the damage uh you know i did not get that exactly what the you know the i can be asking about but what are calling mainly when we produce let's say what are calling may happen in a vertical well also may happen if you (1:16:54) if we have a horizontal one so when we produce in a rate higher than the optimum you keep getti so if you have (1:18:22) something like this and you find yourself getting a lot of water and you are producing a lot in a high rate let's say lower your production rate a little bit and see what will happen shut down your well for you know a few days and see what will happen if you shut down your well for a few days until this water cone relax and go back again then you start producing in a lower rate if you see this problem gone it means most likely this is was a water corning and not um a for l the required personnel information form with the same email you are going to use for the quizzes and the exams (1:20:11) and also third do the required quizzes they are for and the final exam which will be held by the end of the course and the date will be posted on the facebook page otherwise you won't be able to get your certificate uh now regarding uh for signing up and google classroom problems and troubleshooting please refer to the link i have sent in the chat box"
