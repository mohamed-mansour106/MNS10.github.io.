        <p>
            "(00:58) you hello and welcome for everybody this is me again Ahmed Al Gore here will be moderating this technical session and today we have a session with engineer Yousef it was early it will be about track equipment and operations hopefully you will like this session before we start introducing our instructor today please just one second I will use the YouTube okay so before we start a one I have two announcement for you first if you did not find a variable spot attending on zoom because we hav e only 1000 place in June so please don't feel (01:51) sad about it just go and watch the video on YouTube it will not affect your grade again this clearly do not affect your grade we encourage all of you to attend on Zoom but in case if you did not find available spot just go and watch in YouTube and please if you watch in YouTube please try to write comments write questions what comments try to discuss with with us and with yokoo needs second please try as soon as possible to finish your regis tration on Google classroom because we have quizzes many queries for you and (02:29) there is a due date for these quizzes let me begin start introducing music when were seriously receive is one of my best friends I met him in 2014 at Texas Tech University at the time I was doing my PhD he was finishing his undergrad as a petroleum engineer and he stopped doing his master he get a Master degree also from Texas Tech University and by the way he was the top-ranked student had the petroleum enginee ring department also he was one of the top four and all engineering at Texas Tech so he's really (03:10) very smart guy so you after he finished his master he get a job with Papa - as a frack engineer field effect engineer he worked with them for a few years later he moved to FMC Technique FMC as also as a FAQ and completion and dwelling engineer so he has a lot of you know good experience about hydraulic fracturing and completion in general and hopefully you will like his session yourself go ah ead thank you very much doctor I met the first of all I would like to thank you behalf of all the students for organizing this internship and also for (03:58) inviting me as one of your lecture so thank you very much for the honor today I'm gonna be talking about FAQ equipment and operations so it's not gonna be very technical it's not a classroom lecture it's more gonna be equipment picture from the field how everything is done in the field I know that doctor guy he is trying to make this as an internship as in field internship and because of everything that happened this year it couldn't happen for you guys so hopefully you will learn a lot from this (04:32) experience and again there's gonna be another lecture next week it's gonna be videos from the field so if there's anything that you feel you didn't learn from this lecture or you couldn't visualize it in this lecture please put that in the comments and we'll try to have that as a video on next week so I'll start with an introduct ion as where is hydraulic fracturing real quick I'm not gonna get really into the details then I'll show you guys what a flat frack location looks like looks like the (05:07) frack equipment the wellhead and then wireline because in hydraulic fracturing fracturing goes along with wireline you do plug in curve so you have to have both on location and then finally we'll close with the questions so what is fracturing it's a well stimulation technique that usually in the key premiere is usually used in low permeability formations but again it's also used in high permeability formations when you have as I said there's wireline so wireline comes in they create the shots (05:43) or the purse and then frag comes after that creates fractures how do you create factories you inject factory fluid at a very high rate and very high pressure and then you pump also in your fracturing fluid sand to keep the fracture open so you have water it's gonna open up the fracture then you have San go in whenever d the most important component of the fracturing fluid is water so you have to have water or fluid on location this is where you store your sand or the proppant prompt into the correct term for sand we have the chemicals we have blender pumps manifold wellhead wireline (07:11) and so on so in this lecture I'll try to go as detailed as I can to every single one of these components so that you guys can have an idea of what a location looks like so again these are some more as I said since frack lo and 1502 1002 is for 10k 1502 is for 15k so someone might ask me what's Kate what's 10k 15k 10k is 10,000 psi so you can go up to 10,000 psi it's rated for 10,000 psi 15 is for 15,000 psi so depending on the formation that you're fracking or the design of the (09:08) frack job you'll either have 10 or 15 K obviously the 15k is more expensive because it can tolerate high pressure there's a simple equation don't need to worry about it without the floor II so the floor is the king go inside of this it's called a right now so the missile is here in the middle to help with that rig up how what do I mean by help in the rig up whenever you get your pumps you want to connect them to the missile that's easy right you just have couple connections to make but it's also used to equalize the lines you want to make sure that every single (10:55) line is giving you the exact same not the exact same but about the same rate and pressure so again that's why you use a missile on the missile we have this d e now the check valve this is a check valve but also loops but also this is a check valve it's just different sides and the check valve allows you to go to have the flow go in one direction so you can have fluid going from this side all the way to this side which we said is the wellhead side but what if now there's a k-crew whatever and you have fluid trying to go back from the right side to the left side the check valve is gonna stop it's not gonna allow (12:53) it usually it's a a flapper righ s (14:07) rated for 10,000 psi and for some reason over we're over pressurizing right and we get to 11,000 feet I well this is gonna ruin all of our equipment on location and we don't want that to happen so we have equipment like these to that sense or have some kind of sensor that whenever you get you set it up whenever you get to like 9500 or 10,000 psi let's get a bleed off pressure so you're gonna have pressure coming out from here and from here in which is gonna keep your pressure to 10000 hoses they're rated for 150 psi whereas the discharge hoses are rated for 400 psi the suction hoses (16:02) they're wide from the inside to prevent collapse because imagine you're sucking on a straw well you don't want it to collapse that's why it's right from the inside there's also some acid hoses where which are different they're coated inside to protect the hose itself because acid is corrosive and what we try to have him in a different color to identify them make sure that we don't mix the so see it's called a chem ed or a chemical truck whatever right it has different names but let's (17:47) just talk about the chemicals themselves so it's there to pump chemicals to the blender okay everything meets into the blender so it has pumps and we'll talk about different kind of pumps and also has toads that you can set on on the trailer here are the toads a tote is basically a compartment that holds around 300 gallons of chemical so there is Waukesha pump eccentric pumps and triplex pump sition right so it's it's putting this dark that doesn't talk to that doesn't allow sunlight to go in because you don't want the chemical to get hot so again it depends (19:49) on the chemical depends on the composition of the chemical we also have ISOs which are big totes we'll call it big totes it can hold up to 5,000 gallons of fluid and usually use it with the chemicals that we use the most which is usually fr friction reducer now that we talked about the water chemicals let's talk about the right usually there's six of them but again it's customizable and you filled them up with drugs so you have a truck that comes to location so sorry let me just back up (21:29) the same things whenever they're empty they leave and you get another more right the silos on the contrary are stationary they stay on location and the scent comes to the silo how do they come they come in these same trucks that are here as you can see there's like four of them here they're backed up the empty empty they tom and that's how you fill up your silo this is the conveyor belt think of it as the conveyor belt at the supermarket you know when you go to the supermarket and then you put your stuff on a conveyor belt and then it goes to the cashier same thing here so whenever (23:12) you want to use a silo you slide the gate same goes on to the their belt over here right and then it slides all the way till it gets ear dumped into the hopper which is the part of the blender that collects the same now let's head so let's see let's talk about the blender which is the heart beat of the treatment it's the most important part because that's where the water comes in from the fluid storage the sand comes in right from the aside from the silos and the chemicals come in from the c10 right they're all collected into the stub top just like (24:59) your bathtub it's a tub where everything gets put together so this is the hopper where the same gets dumped and then you have augers which is which like spins righ is is the dense summary that we talked about it looks the exact same as the other did sound around the missile okay it treats the density and this is the auger that I was telling you about that spins and whenever every time it spins it dumps it collects a sign from the bottom and takes it to the teller so small break let's see what he talked about till this minute so we talked about the chemicals talked about the water food storage we (26:58) talked about prop and storage the same everything get zes the fluid and so the (28:27) fluid comes in these houses as we said houses are for low pressure so using low pressure red fluid comes here goes into the fluid in gets pressurized and then comes out from the high end part of the fluid in which is iron 10,000 or 15,000 psi and then goes to the missile so one important thing about the pump or the fluid end is that it has to be supplied boost from the blender the boost has to be at least a hundred psi that's very important because the fluid end right you see this pump operator so he operates the pump there is no one outside to operate the pump the pump (30:18) operator is inside of the dead oven right every line here is a pump so just like a car car goes from first to second to third gear he is the one who drives the pump he's the one who goes from first second to third gear and he also sees the RPM of the pump a also sees he monitors the temperature the whole pressure all that stuff if something goes bad he's gonna get an alarm and th ks like you have screens the screens show pressure rate same concentration chemical concentration everything that the treater and the company men need to know remember when (32:12) we talked about the silo and how the silo is controlled from a computer open it close it percentages it's this box so on this box you'll see you can clearly see percentages saddle number one is open saddle number two is closed and and so on so now that we talked about how we prepare our chemical fluid or the fracturin I'm sure so the wellhead again this is a different configuration of wellhead it's basically a set of valves to control the well in case it's it's it's fair for to control the well so sir it's for well control so we want to have at least all (34:17) the time barriers to protect from any kick from the formation from any uncontrolled pressure so we have to have at least two different barriers so in this case here we have two barriers which are two master valves the lower one is called lower master wanna you want when you retrieve whatever you pumped right how are you gonna get it out it's gonna it's gonna come out from the bottom it's gonna come out here and then where's it gonna go you don't want it to be coming from the top yeah you want it to be controlled so it's gonna go to one wing which is the (35:57) flow back and then from here it can go to a pit it can go to a tank it can go to a container whatever but that's how you flow back so and the other side is pumped down what is pumped ils later about zipper fracturing but how do you control your flow how do you make sure that your flow goes into the white well and not the red well that's one thing the second thing is when you're done with the white well how do you go quickly to the red well that's when you have come something called a zipper manifold which is just a set of (37:49) valves right whenever you want to go to the white well you close all the other valves and open the valves for the white well which are these two wh this this iron and all these swivels iron all the valves the ground valves blah blah blah replacing all of them with this flexible line which is a hose but it's a hose that it's rated to 15,000 psi it's just it's a special hose so this is just something new that we didn't have before and now that we're offering so it helps you for cleaner rigged up also for failures instead of (39:35) having 15 different pieces of pipes that you have to hook up together any connection can fail right so that's 1 tion you have to have wireline and frack it's they do plug and curve operations right what is plugging perth plugin proof is wireline comes in drops a gun right whenever the gun gets into this horizontal section what did we say we do to have the guns move we pump water pump down pump down gets the gun pushes it to whatever we set it and then whenever we're ready to set it we shoot we set the plug and then you retract a little (41:40) bit and then you shoot why do you set a plug you set a plug to th this (43:02) section reject set another plug shoot another set of pair frak and so on so everywhere can have 50 stages 60 stages 100 stages it depends on the operator and their design and maybe you'll have wells that have even less that's gonna have even less [Music] there's gonna have even less stages so now let's see what wireline looks like so here this is a crane that holds the wireline lubricator which is where the guns sit right so the guns sit in this lubricator and then gets connected ake sure that the gun is heavy enough to drop vertically with gravity right and (45:13) then on the bottom part in the very bottom part you can see this part which is the plug so this is the plug like we said we plug right we set a plug and then the gun gets disconnected from the plug and then you shoot your guns so the guns come out every time and then they get changed but the plug stays in to inside of the well and then whenever it's time to produce you either drill out these plugs or some plu with submitting a PDF version from your presentation yeah yeah that's no problem you need to check with manager no problem I probably need to check real quick but most probably it's gonna be fine okay so the second question is we have when we do fraction what is the reasons for doing hydraulic fracturing so we talked about this a little bit and I'm not really so I'll told you guys so we said that fracturing is usually done in low permeability formation so in shale right whenever we (47:38) have e second question what is the difference between permeability and (48:57) conductivity because you use the term you are enhancing conductivity yeah so connectivity is a function of permeability but but they're not the same thing permeability is a property of the formation what a conductivity is just F in how conductive a path is yeah so we've got about that fracture widths and we could've a yeah okay so it's a for Tolan question someone asked me what is the purpose of iron it's interact he did n d see if there's any leaks so but again you don't want to have the company that made your iron tested for you so sometimes you have (51:09) other companies that would go to a third party or a competitor to test your art okay thank you for the answers the next question is I'm not sure if he's asking about your own experience do you frack only using wireline and you know two paths or you use TCP over the cube and conveyed deflation so no I the background behind this is in Middle East most likely b eans that we connect hydraulic hoses to it and from outside of the red zone I think I have a picture here and here it is so you have this thing which is called an accumulator which is outside the far away from the red zone and it had a (53:10) handle and again I'll show you do guys this next week it has a handle for open or closed so whenever I say whenever it's closed then I go to open it pumps hydraulic fluid the hydraulic fluid gets into the actuator here right and pushes the gate so so we ha o the environment to the ground to the trees to whatever is under but on the other hand if we go to Texas for example see that's picture from Texas there is nothing you can see here there is water might be chemicals we don't know they they're not as strict as other states so going back to the (55:13) environment point you'll see that PS they might be damage to the environment on the surface and every state has different rules on the impact of that Texas for example might say yep some water and s nd the elections you'll see that oil and gas and fracturing is a big topic whenever it comes to a presidential debate in the u.s. between Democrats and Republicans yes I remember you know miss Warren was one of the you know I'm from the Democrats she mentioned before if she become a president she will stop tracking United States which is I believe not something doable anyway so someone asking about do (57:10) we use all of these equipment because I know their pictures you showed us today kind of open he can hold so he has yeah so the same thing every compartment can hold up to 50,000 and it has it has five compartments there is also the same boxes that I'm gonna show next week the same box can hold up to 50,000 also around 40 to 50,000 and then there is the same truck that I showed that comes and dumps into the silo the same truck can hold based on the same truck with the same drugs that I showed can hold approximately 36,000 from you from thirty to thirty five thirty six thousand fift so so yeah it varies and it depends on come on the customer and I (1:00:31) know that offshore for example they use even more sand well yeah that's the answer your question okay so I have two more questions one about how to prevent sand from coming back again to the water so that's the that's the thing it's whenever you're fracking if you have pressure if you see that your pressure is starting to increase right this means that you're saying is not going into the fracturing that it's accumulatin e surface throw it and start a frack stage again so these are the different ways that we do to a different path that we have to prevent (1:02:14) that problem to happen the last question is an easy one someone asking about what is the thoughts and silos where's what thoughts and silence trucks in silos yes so Sallu as we said is a compartment that allows you to store send easier so this let's talk first about the silo so that's the silo which is this vertical compartment that we used to store an al quick if you don't mind the first comment is again like we said just to make sure that you guys get the most out of it if you have any questions or need to see anything please tell us in the comments what like you didn't visualize (1:04:32) like you want to get a video of the pump whatever and the second comment is I would like to thank you dr. gray for this opportunity and as I said at the beginning setting this thing up is is very beneficial for all the students tha"
